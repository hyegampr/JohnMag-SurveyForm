# Sample-Project
Sample project working on learning github

Goal is to learn what I can do with github. Will focus on seeing what can be uploaded to github and in what file source it can maintain.

Will hopefully learn how to use Git and Github.

Spend small amounts of time on this each day to contribute to growth of knowledge.
